What is new in KD Reports 1.6
===============================

Performance:
---------
* Added KDReports::Report::beginEdit/endEdit. Call beginEdit before adding all your elements
  and endEdit afterwards, so that no relayouting happens while adding the elements, thus
  making report generation on long reports much faster.

Bug fixes:
