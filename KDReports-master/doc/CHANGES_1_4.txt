What is new in KD Reports 1.4
===============================

Features:
---------

* Setting the page number of the first page, so that the variable PageNumber
  starts at another value than 1. This is useful when composing a large report
  from smaller reports. See Report::setFirstPageNumber.

* Added example for setFirstPageNumber and for generating a table of contents.

Bug fixes:
----------
* Fix compilation with gcc-4.6

* Preserve font when inserting a variable, and when updating a variable value
  later on (KDRE-91)

* printWithDialog() didn't handle page ranges (KDRE-94)

* Fix support for empty text elements with an ID (<text id="someid"/>)

* Fix implementation of vertical spacing so that it works before the first element too,
and so that multiple spacings can be added in sequence.

* associateTextValue now also updates headers and footers, when being called
after the document was loaded (KDRE-192)

Performance fixes:
------------------

* KDRE-74: Remove internal QPrinter object in Report class, to gain some performance.
