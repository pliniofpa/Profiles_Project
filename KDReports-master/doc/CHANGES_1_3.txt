What is new in KD Reports 1.3
===============================

Features:

* Spreadsheet mode, for faster and more powerful printing of large tables.
  The table can be broken across multiple pages horizontally and vertically, and
  can be forced to fit into N*M pages, using a smaller font if necessary.
  See Report::setReportMode for the difference betweeen the two modes.

* New XML tag <hline/> to simplify the use of horizontal lines in XML.
  Support for custom color, configurable thickness and margin.
  XmlElementHandler has a new virtual method hLineElement, called upon parsing a
  hline, but this new virtual is only enabled if KDReports is compiled with
  the define KDREPORTS_ALLOW_BINARY_INCOMPATIBILITY.

* New XML tag <ifdef id="..."> to skip sections of the XML template when a
  text value is empty. Note: this is only evaluated at loading time, changing
  the text value later on will not have an effect on the skipping of sections.

* Support for configuring the charts: new constructor ChartElement(KDChart::Chart*)
  for charts created in code, and setChart(KDChart::Chart*) for setting the
  chart from the XmlElementHandler.

* Improved charts rendering and printing by drawing charts at full resolution,
  without the use of an intermediate pixmap.

* New method setDefaultFont for all table elements.

* Support for left-aligned, center-aligned, and right-aligned text on the same line,
  automatically adjusting to the page width: Report::middleAlignedTab and
  Report::rightAlignedTab.

* Paragraph margins can now be adjusted.

* Mail merge support (see examples/MailMergeXML).

* Support for adding images from threads, with ImageElement(QImage).

* Report::exportToImage() can now be used from a secondary thread.

* Remove page breaks when exporting to an image or printing on an endless printer.
